            Season for Social Justice Identity

        <h2>
            Client: Old St. Patrick's Church
        </h2>
        <h4>Brief</h4>
        <p>
            Old St. Patrick's Church has an annual season for social justice and
            each year it focuses on a new topic. In 2015, the big question that
            the church wanted people to think about was how are we to act? As a
            designer, I was ordered to create something insightful that would attract
            the eyes of the general public and congregation. What was required was an
            outdoor banner, a website banner, publication advertisements and print ephemera to be given during mass.
        </p>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>
            This was a very interesting project to work on because I was very unfamiliar with
            designing for a church. I looked through the church's archives to see if I could
            find any reference material which I fortunately did. Also, I asked the project manager
            a million questions which helped immensely. While working, I presented high-fidelity
            concepts and experimented with color, typography, and size.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            The title of the season for social justice was We belong to God. We belong to each
            other. How are we to act? Such a powerful statement deserves to be at the center of
            attention. I created the identity in black & white to give it a feel of power and
            humility. The majority of design was done with special attention to typography and
            hierarchy. Overall, the project was well received.
